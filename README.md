# Economics Research

Just a couple of the several economics project I worked on while an RA for the BYU Economics Department and a student in the economics major.

#### Cost_of_Homeschooling.ipynb (written in R)

Some of the data analysis that went into determining the effect that maternal education and household income had on the probability of the child being homeschooled.
Note that not all of the data analysis is presented here. A draft of the paper is included as Homeschool_v11.pdf. Additional analysis were composed in Stata.

#### Marriage_Income.ipynb 

This project aimed to determine the effect that having a child before vs after marriage had on earnings later in life.
